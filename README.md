Project name: Know Your Slytherin

Author name: Kevin Irungu

Description of project:

This is a web application targeted at fans of the Harry Potter franchise. It fetches data from a public API consisting of information regarding Harry Potter characters. That is; their picture, name, species, gender, date of birth, wizard ability, ancestry and actor. 

On the page is a list of the names of members of House Slytherin. When clicked, the aforementioned details are displayed on the right-hand side of the page. The user may also choose to highlight the names of those of pure-blood ancestry, or even half-blood ancestry, to ease their search.
