            <p>Slytherin House maintains Salazar's values, which are cunning, ambition, and fraternity. Like Salazar, students in Slytherin tend to value pure-blood heritage, and the competition between Slytherin House and Gryffindor House mirrors the feud between Salazar and Godric. The Slytherin House common room is located in the Hogwarts dungeons, and the house crest is green and features a fork-tongued serpent. Due to Slytherin's association with pure-blood supremacy, the house does have a bit of a stigmatized reputation, and students from the house are sometimes seen as self-serving. This is seen, for example, when Slytherin students flee during the Battle of Hogwarts, choosing to save themselves over facing Lord Voldemort. However, it should be noted that not all Slytherins are bad, and the characteristics associated with the house can also be used for good.Quite a few important wizards and witches have come out of Slytherin and, unfortunately, a good deal of them are unusually fond of dark magic. Perhaps the most notorious example is Tom Riddle, more commonly known as Voldemort, who becomes one of the most feared dark wizards in wizarding history. Plenty of his Death Eaters are also from Slytherin House, including Lucius Malfoy, Narcissa Malfoy, and Bellatrix Lestrange.
